# hello-world
First module 
Hi! My name is Grace Gerow and I am a senior at SMU graduating this December. I am majoring in Economics and minoring in Business. I am also a transfer student, and even though I have been here since 2021 I am still getting used to campus. 
Besides Econ I love painting/drawing, creative writing, and volunteering at animal shelters!
